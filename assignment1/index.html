    showcases Frank
    Gehry’s design process through sketches, videos, and dynamic interactions. With its bold visuals and seamless
    navigation, the site functions as a digital exhibition, offering an engaging way to explore architectural
    storytelling. This analysis evaluates its design, user experience, and effectiveness in conveying the creative
    journey behind the concert hall.</p>
