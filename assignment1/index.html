    <h1>Website Review</h1>
    <h2>Questions 1</h2>
    <h3>
      What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
      experience?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The first thing that caught my attention was how visually distinct and
      bright the website was compared to other sites. The scribbled sketches and
      bold colour choices immediately stood out, creating a playful and artistic
      atmosphere. Despite the serious nature of the project, the design choices
      made the experience feel more engaging and immersive. The juxtaposition of
      fun, bold playful font with an architectural subject was particularly
      striking. Additionally, the inclusion of background music was
      unexpected—it contrasted with the visual style, adding an extra layer of
      intrigue to the experience. The interactive elements, such as how
      different parts of the site reacted to the mouse cursor and the
      integration of sound, also set it apart from conventional websites, making
      it feel more like an interactive exhibition than a typical webpage.
    </p>

    <h2>Question 2</h2>
    <h3>
      Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
      discrete actions.
    </h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Scrolling vertically through the content</li>
      <li>Clicking on buttons to navigate or trigger interactions</li>
      <li>Hovering over elements to see how they respond to the cursor</li>
      <li>Watching embedded videos to understand more about the project</li>
      <li>Listening to the background music and sound effects</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Question 3</h2>
    <h3>
      What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with? I
      spent the most time engaging with the videos.
    </h3>

    <p>
      Initially, the website didn’t explicitly state what it was about, which
      made me curious. Watching the videos and reading the accompanying text
      provided insight into the purpose of the site and the creative process
      behind the Walt Disney Concert Hall. The videos served as a key element in
      giving an insight to the design and thinking behind the project, helping
      me fully grasp the project’s significance.
    </p>

    <h2>Question 4</h2>
    <h3>
      What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
      experience?
    </h3>

    <p>
      The most common action was vertical scrolling. The site is designed to be
      explored in a linear, flowing manner, guiding users through the content at
      their own pace.
    </p>

    <h2>Question 5</h2>
    <h3>What is the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>

    <p>
      The website serves as an interactive showcase for the Walt Disney Concert
      Hall, offering an in-depth look at Frank Gehry’s creative process. It
      functions as a digital exhibition, preserving and presenting the sketches,
      concepts, and development stages behind the concert hall’s design. Beyond
      celebrating Gehry’s work, the site also aims to educate visitors about
      architectural creativity and the meticulous planning behind iconic
      structure.
    </p>

    <h2>Question 6</h2>

    <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
    
    <p> The experience effectively communicates its goal through a combination of
      visuals, videos, and interactive elements: 
      
      <ul> 
        
      <li>Sketches & Animations: The
        hand-drawn sketches and loose, scribbled lines immediately highlight Gehry’s
        distinctive creative process,
      </li>  

      <li> Videos & Audio: The site incorporates
        documentary-style videos where Gehry himself discusses his work, adding
        depth and authenticity.
      </li>

      <li> Seamless Navigation: The smooth scrolling and
          transitions create a guided, almost museum-like journey, mirroring the
          experience of walking through an exhibition.
        </li>
  
      <li>Music & Sound Design: The
        choice of background music and interactive sound elements enhance the
        immersive nature of the experience.
      </li>
    
      </ul>
      
      Together, these elements create a
      dynamic and engaging way for users to explore the architectural journey
      behind the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
    </p>


    <h2> Question 7</h2>
    <h3> What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time?</h3>
  
    <p>This website functions like
      a permanent digital exhibition. It’s designed for users to explore at their
      own pace, whether they are first-time visitors seeking an overview or
      architecture enthusiasts returning to analyse details more deeply. While it
      may not require repeated visits for casual users, those interested in
      architecture, design, or Gehry’s work might revisit it for inspiration or
      research.
    </p>


    <h2>Question 8</h2>
    <h3> How does the interactive experience communicate how it should
     be interacted with over time?</h3>

 
     <p>The website is structured as a linear,
    narrative-driven experience, encouraging a one-time deep dive rather than
    frequent revisits. Unlike a traditional blog or news site that updates
    regularly, this platform functions as a digital archive—users can explore
    the content whenever they like, but there’s no strong incentive for repeat
    visits unless they have a particular interest in Gehry’s work.</p>


    <h2>Question 9</h2>
    <h3> What other
    media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>

    <p>The website closely mimics the experience of a physical exhibition:
     
      <ul> 
      <li>Gallery-style presentation: The placement of videos, sketches, and text
        resembles curated sections of an art or design museum.</li> 
        
        <li>Linear storytelling:
          The website guides users from concept sketches to completed work, much like
          a museum exhibit’s progression.</li> 
          
          <li>
            Tactile interactions: The site’s interactive
      elements—such as animations responding to mouse movement—evoke the feeling
      of engaging with a hands-on display.
          </li> 
          
    </ul>
        
    This approach makes the experience more
    immersive, encouraging users to explore Gehry’s work as if they were walking
    through a real-world exhibition.</p>

    <h2> Question 10</h2>
     <h3>What does this reference/s communicate
      to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
       
      <p>The site encourages a self-paced, exploratory approach, much like a visitor
        in a physical museum. Users are free to skim through the content or dive
        deeper into the videos and sketches depending on their level of interest.
        This design choice makes it clear that the experience is meant to be
        engaging but not restrictive—users can interact with the site in a way that
        best suits their curiosity. </p>
    

   <h2>Question 11</h2>
  
   <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to
    you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
      
    <p>The site balances playfulness and sophistication, creating a sense of
      curiosity and appreciation. The bright colours, sketch-like elements and
      big, bold heading give it an informal, artistic feel, while the classical
      music and documentary-style videos reinforce the seriousness of Gehry’s
      work. This mix of modern and classical elements mirrors the Walt Disney
      Concert Hall itself—an architectural feat that blends avant-garde design
      with traditional concert hall elegance
    </p>

      <h2>Question 12
      </h2>

      <h3>What is the most frustrating part
        of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>

        <p>One
          potential frustration is the repetitive nature of interactions. While the
          initial experience is engaging, after a while, the scrolling and predictable
          layout make it feel less dynamic. Additionally, like a physical exhibition,
          if a user isn’t deeply interested in the topic, they may lose engagement
          quickly since there’s no strong incentive to stay beyond initial curiosity.</p>
<h2>Question 13</h2>

        <h3>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
          makes that part satisfying?</h3>

          <p>The smooth transitions and animation effects
            were the most satisfying part of the interaction. The zooming in and out
            between sections felt seamless, giving the experience a cinematic quality.
            This fluidity enhanced the storytelling aspect, making it feel less like a
            traditional website and more like an immersive digital experience.</p>
